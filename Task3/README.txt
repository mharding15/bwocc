README for Programming task 3

The program 'bbwocc' can be built using the included Makefile. Just run "make" and it should build the program. Once built you can run it by executing "./bbwocc build <reference file> <reference occ table file>". Then you can run queries on the reference by executing "./bwocc query <reference occ table file> <query file>" where the query file has a list of query strings, one per line.
